# Privacy Policy for Screener Transcript Helper
Last Updated: June 22, 2025

This privacy policy outlines how the "Screener Transcript Helper" Chrome Extension ("the Extension") handles data.

Data We Process
To provide its core functionality, the Extension processes the following information:

Transcript URLs: When a user selects a transcript to interact with, the URL of that specific PDF document is collected.
User Questions: The questions that a user types into the chat sidebar are collected.
How We Use Data
The collected Transcript URL and User Question are sent to our secure backend API. Our backend then uses this information to retrieve the document's content and communicate with a third-party AI service (OpenAI) to generate an answer.

Data Storage and Personal Information
We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information. The data processing is stateless, meaning the transcript URL and question are used only for the immediate purpose of generating an answer and are not saved or logged on our servers.
